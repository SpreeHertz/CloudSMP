# More info

### Fixed vanilla game bugs

There are many annoying vanilla game bugs that can be exploitable. We've added a plugin that fixes it all.

### Chest shops (barter system)

You can sell items with players.

### Automatically unlock recipes

Instead of slowly unlocking recipes in your recipes book, you instantly unlock everything instead.

### AFK Display

When a player is AFK for some minutes, their name is greyed out.

### Better sleeping

Instead of making the whole server sleep, only a lower amount of players have to sleep.

### Custom Nether portals

Self-explanatory.

### Scoreboards & track statistics

In the hub, you can see who has the most kills, who killed the most mobs, and much more.

### rtp (random-tp)

You can get randomly teleported while in the world.

### Health bars

This feature will help you when you PvP or kill a mob. Whenever you damage an entity, you can see it above.

### Elevators

The elevators are defined by a combination of two blocks. Single block elevators are also possible. (An unlimited amount of combinations can be defined in the config) Press Space to go one floor up, and press Shift to go one floor down. It's that Simple!

### Quests

When you click on an NPC, it'll tell you about optional quests that you can complete in order to get rewards.

### Bosses

Other than the Ender dragon, the Wither and the Elder Guardian, there are many other bosses that you can spawn in. Don't worry, they don't spawn very frequently. Whenever you sucessfully kill a boss, you get interesting non-vanilla items as a reward.


### Custom structures 

Just like villages, there are other modified and cool-looking custom structures that spawn in frequently.

### Modified end and tougher end structures

As everyone knows, the end is just filled with boring End Stones and end structures. In order to spice it up a little, we've added custom end biomes and structures.

### Rope-like ladders

You can now use rope-like ladders instead of manually placing it in the vanilla way.

### LandClaim

Pretty self explanatory: Claim about 750 blocks of land. This can be integrated with the [clan-making/team-making plugin](#advanced-team-making).

### Better whitelisting system
 
Instead of staff manually whitelisting players on Discord, you can do `/whitelist add minecraft_username` as a slash command on the server and automatically whitelist yourself. Just make sure that you complete the anti-alt verification on the server.

### Better Proximity VoiceChat
 
 You don't need to join a Discord voice channel, nor do you need to install any clients. You just have to run a command and let your browser run in the background.
 
### Advanced Team-making

You can now make teams with your friends, integrate it with land-claim, and you also get private text channels on Discord just for your team.

### PvP arena

You can dual with players and maybe even make a war!
