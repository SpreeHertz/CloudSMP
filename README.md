### The Discord bot
Cloud SMP Discord bot is a bot ran by [Team Cloud](https://twitter.com/cloudstriked) and made by [SpreeHertz](https://github.com/spreehertz). This bot was made for utility in the [SMP Discord server](https://discord.gg/kYBwmzyMPT).

### Note

Cloud SMP's code is open sourced to allow the community to contribute to its development. You can contribute by submitting a pull request to the `master` branch. We expect a clear description of what your PR is about and what problem does it solve/feature does it add. Make sure to use appropriate formatting when you make contributions. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/755826968901058682). The code is NOT adaptive, so you might have to change a lot of values to selfhost. Everyone who contributes using a PR and has specified their Discord username will get a role on the Discord server as a reward.

âš  **We do not allow people to host their own clone of Cloud SMP publicly or provide support for it. Only selfhosting for strictly private use is allowed.**
